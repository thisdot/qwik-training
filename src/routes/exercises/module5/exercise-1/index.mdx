import Exercise from './exercise'

Just like `Slot` in the WebComponent, qwik use `Slot` to allow user inject their own contents.
In the above example, the content from the parent content will be injected and rendered to the Project component.
The `q:slot` syntax can specify the name of the slot.

## Exercise 5-1:

1. Open src/routes/exercises/module5/exercise-1/exercise.tsx
2. Use unamed default Slot to show content from parent

<Exercise />
