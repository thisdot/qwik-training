---

Qwik supports Vitest test framework integration. Qwik also provides several helper method to make the test easier.

We can call use createDOM() function to get the helper render function and screen object.
So we can render the component we want to test and use the screen to test the output html.

## Exercise 7-1:

1. Open src/components/example/example.spec.tsx
2. Update
   - the first `[ExampleTest Component]: Should render ‚≠ê` case
   - the second `[ExampleTest Component]: Should render üí£` case
