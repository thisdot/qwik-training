title: Track input change and trigger fetch query from github

import Exercise from './exercise'

We usually use useTask$() to update some intermediate state, if we want to watch some input and render the template directly,
we can use useResource$(), useResource$() is asynchronous and can run multiple asynchronous operations parallelly.
The common use case is to fetch some data from the server and render the template.

## Exercise 4-5:

1. Open src/routes/exercises/module4/exercise-5/exercise.tsx
2. Track input change and trigger fetch query from github

<Exercise />
