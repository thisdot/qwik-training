title: implement computed value with useTask$()

import Exercise from './exercise'

Qwik also supports computed values.
Computed values mean when you want to have some value calculated based on other value (the other value mostly from the props).
For example, you have a `first name` and `last name` from the component props, and you want to have a `full name` value
calculated based on the `first name` and the `last name` value, you can create a computed value, many frameworks support
computed value, Qwik also support this feature.
There are two ways to create computed value

- useTask$()
- useResource$()

## Exercise 4-4:

1. Open src/routes/exercises/module4/exercise-4/exercise.tsx
2. monitor `state.count` update with `useTask$()`
