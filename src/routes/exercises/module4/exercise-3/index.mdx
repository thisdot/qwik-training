title: Access todo data provided with useContext()

import Exercise from './exercise'

Passing store data from parent component to child component is straightforward,
but if you have components with deep nested relationships, passing data through Props
will become hard and not effective (since the pass through components doesnâ€™t really use these props).

Qwik provides context to allow the parent component pass data to the children component.

## Exercise 4-3:

1. Open src/routes/exercises/module4/exercise-3/exercise.tsx
2. Access todo data provided with `useContext()`

<Exercise />
