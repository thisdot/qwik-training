import Exercise from './exercise'

Qwik provides a built in reactive state manage mechanism, we can call useSignal()/useStore() method to create a reactive state and use the state in the JSX template.

- useSignal() create primitive reactive value.
- useStore() create an Object reactive value, which internally creates several nested signal reactive value.

The state of Qwik is not component state, you can call useSignal() anywhere in your application.
The state created by useSignal()/useStore() is reactive. That means if the state is updated, all impacted components will be rendered automatically if needed.

## Exercise 4-1:

1. Open src/routes/exercises/module4/exercise-1/exercise.tsx
2. Use useStore() to hold the component data.

<Exercise />
