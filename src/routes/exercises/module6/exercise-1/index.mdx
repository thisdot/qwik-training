title: use useStyles$() to apply the styles.

import Exercise from './exercise'

In qwik, you can load global styles and the style will be applied to the whole application.
But donâ€™t include all styles especially the component style into the global css file.
Since the global style is downloaded eagerly even when the component is not visible.

## Exercise 6-1:

1. Open src/routes/exercises/module6/exercise-1/exercise.tsx
2. use `useStyles$()` to apply the styles.

<Exercise />
