import Exercise from './exercise'

Just like component$(), qwik provides useStyles$() to lazy load styles for the component only when needed.

## Exercise 6-2:

1. Open src/routes/exercises/module5/exercise-2/exercise.tsx
2. use useStylesScope$() to apply the styles only to the Parent component.

<Exercise />
