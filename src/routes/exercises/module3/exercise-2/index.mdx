title: Prevent Event Listener
---

import Exercise from './exercise'

Another common use case is to prevent the default behavior of the event listener,
for example, you have an event listener for a href element, and after the event listener
you want to cancel the default behavior so the browser will continue to navigate to the href location.
You can use a specified preventdefault:eventName attribute to the element.

## Exercise 3-2:

1. Open src/routes/exercises/module3/exercise-2/exercise.tsx
2. Change onClick to add a preventDefault event listener

<Exercise />
