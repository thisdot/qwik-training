import Exercise from './exercise'

## Exercise 3-4:

You can also define your own event for a component, and pass the event listener to the component,
so the outside component can react when the customized event triggered.

1. Open src/routes/exercises/module3/exercise-4/exercise.tsx
2. Add onDblclick event listener and trigger onMyClick callback to implement the custom event

<Exercise />
