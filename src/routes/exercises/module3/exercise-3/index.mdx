title: Add event listener programmatically
---

import Exercise from './exercise'

## Exercise 3-3:

Sometimes you want to add the event listener programmatically instead of
defining in the template in some advanced scenario. For example, the eventName is unknown until runtime.

1. Open src/routes/exercises/module3/exercise-3/exercise.tsx
2. Add a click event listener programmatically with `useOn()`

<Exercise />
