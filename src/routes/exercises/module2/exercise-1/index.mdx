## Component data binding

Component is using JSX template, so all your syntax highlighting tools or IDE integration for JSX will work seamlessly with qwik component.

What is JSX:

- Extension of Javascript
- Can use the full power of javascript
- Visual element structure
- Rich compiler/bundler/IDE integration support

Also Qwik component can be asynchronous. You can use native async/await when creating qwik component. For example, we may need some dynamic information from the server to create the component.

## Exercise 2-1 binding expression instructions:

1. Open src/routes/exercises/module2/exercise-1/exercise.tsx
2. Use binding expression to add `data.DESCRIPTION` to the template

<Exercise />
